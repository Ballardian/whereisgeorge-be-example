# This would contain all of the test cases for the models in friends app.
# Depending on the number of models, this may be replaced with a folder
# containing a file for each model e.g. friends/tests/models/ModelName.py

# The tests for the models would only be concerned with
# anything additional e.g. validation, properties or methods.
