# whereisgeorge-be-example

Currently WIP
This repo is used to represent the BE file structure and testing for whereisgeorge.app (a private repo).
Note: this is a sample and is non-exhaustive. It won't build, only contains a sample of the tests, and the tests won't run etc - however the code is lifted directly from the whereisgeorge production repo.

The objective is to create an intuitive code base, with a focus on maintainable/testable code. Suggestions are encouraged.
