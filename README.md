# whereisgeorge-be-example

This repo is used to represent the BE file structure and testing for whereisgeorge.app (a private repo).
The friends app and the FriendCreateApi view is included in this repo as an example of the views/services/tests relationship. This hopefully gives an insightful overview to the rationale behind the repo structure and style. This is, of course, opinionated, and any suggestions are welcome and encouraged.
