# This would contain all of the test cases for the views in Example app.
# Depending on the number of views, this may be replaced with a folder
# containing a file for each ViewSet e.g. Example/tests/views/ViewSetName.py

# The tests for the views would only be concerned with
# the request data and the response of the view and the data it returns
# e.g. the request object, data returned from the serializer, the status code of the response etc.
