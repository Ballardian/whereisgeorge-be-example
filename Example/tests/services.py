# This would contain all of the test cases for the services in Example app.
# Depending on the number of services, this may be replaced with a folder
# containing a file for each service class e.g. Example/tests/services/ServiceClassName.py

# The tests for the services would be the most comprehensive and granular,
# as they would test the business logic of the application.
# The tests would cover the methods and properties of the service classes in isolation.
