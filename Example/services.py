# This would contain all of the services for the Example app.
# Depending on the number of services, this may be replaced with a folder
# containing a file for each model e.g. Example/services/ServiceClassName.py

# The services module is a collection of classes that contain the business logic for the application.
# Each class is a service that performs a specific task.
# The service classes are used by the views to perform the business logic.
# The services classes are also tested in the services test module, in isolation from the views and models.
# This allows for easier testing and maintenance of the services.
