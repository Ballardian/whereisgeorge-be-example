# This would contain all of the views for the Example app.
# Depending on the number of views, this may be replaced with a folder
# containing a file for each model e.g. Example/views/ViewSet.py
# This would also contain the serializers for each indivual ViewSet in the Example app.
# e.g InputSerialiser, OutputSerializer etc.

# The views implement very little logic, and are mostly used to call the services and return the response.
# The views are also responsible for handling the request and response objects.
# The views are tested in the views test module, and are only interested in the request and response objects.
# e.g. if a request object with a certain payload is passed, a certain response object is expected to be returned.
